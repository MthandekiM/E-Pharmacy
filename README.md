# E-Pharmacy
Building an E-Pharmacy System in Python

We build a simple yet powerful e-pharmacy system from scratch. This project will cover key concepts such as object-oriented programming, user interaction, and basic data management.

We'll start by defining classes for products and the e-pharmacy itself. Then, we'll implement functionalities for adding products to the inventory and displaying available items. The code will feature a user-friendly command-line interface, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the system.

One of the highlights of this project is the "Process Order" functionality, where users can select items, add them to a shopping cart, and finalize their purchase. We'll handle inventory management, ensuring that product quantities are updated accordingly.
